# Unity-SpaceShooter
At the time that I am making this I was making it on Godot Engine, but as I am still new to Godot I don't understand it that well so I am making it in Unity Engine as well.
The main reason for this is because I want to just practice my skills as well as gain more knowledge/understanding of my skills.
Another reason is that I am trying to beat some boredom.
